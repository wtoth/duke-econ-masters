# Economics Courses

## Econ 601 - Microeconomic Theory
This is a theory heavy course focusing on Consumer Theory, Producer Theory, and General Equilibrium. To succeed in this course you need to be well versed in set theory and writing proofs. Additionally, you need a background in calculus and optimization topics are prevalent throughout the course. 
Resources
- [Proofs and Sets](proofs_and_sets.md)
- Optimization 
    - The Appendix of Advanced Microeconomic Theory by G. Jehle and P. Reny has a good primer on optimization techniques. 
    - Part IV (Chapters 16-22) of Mathematics for Economists by Simon & Blume provides a nice overview with practice problems. Both of these resources are paid.

## Econ 608 - Introduction to Econometrics 
This is a masters level reintroduction to Econometrics focusing on a more rigorous construction of econometrics than in undergraduate courses. The main skills necessary for this course are probability, statistics, linear algebra, and stata. 
Resources
- [Harvard Stats 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube) – A strong refresher for anyone who hasn't taken probability in a while.
- [MIT Intro to Stats for Economics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-30-introduction-to-statistical-methods-in-economics-spring-2009/) – This is a much more rigorous intro to stats via MIT. There are no lecture videos but they have some very concise, albeit tough, lecture notes.   
- [Ben Lamberts youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5SLG7sUa0) – Although this series is directed at undergraduates I found it to be helpful for understanding the intuition of what is taught in econ 608. Note: he also has a graduate level series more similar to what is learned in econ 703. 
- [Gilbert Strangs Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) - I recommend getting to at least lecture 16 (or just reviewing lecture 16) as this course gives a great explanation and intuition for projections and least squares from a linear algebra perspective
