# Proofs and Sets Resources

All Graduate Students in the Economics Department need to know how to write proofs and have at least an elementary understanding of set theory.<br><br>
<u>***Important:***</u> As with all mathematics, it is <u>essential</u> that you take time to do practice problems rather than just reading the theory!!!!


### Free Resources
- [Book of Proof](https://richardhammack.github.io/BookOfProof/) - This is an excellent book for anyone looking to get an introduction to proofs and set theory. Additionally, it contains answers to the odd exercises in the back of the book. We highly recommend all incoming students be familiar with it's material.
- [Demonstration: Proof without a Possibility of Doubt](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/MATH/Mathematical_Writing_A_Primer.pdf) - Similar to the Book of Proof this is an excellent primer for anyone and includes exercises for each topic. However, it does not contain any answers so they would have to be individually searched online.
