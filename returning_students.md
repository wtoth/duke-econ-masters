# Resources for students who took time off in between their undergraduate and this program or those who want to rebuild their quantitative skills

## Overview
Hi! If you're feeling a little rusty on your quantitative background when entering Duke's economics masters programs this is the right place for you. Please note that this is a somewhat common position to be in (the author was in it himself) and does not mean you cannot thrive at Duke! </br>
You will need to put in a lot of work to catch up or surpass your peers but is very manageable as long as you are diligent and honest with yourself in your studies. 

### General Notes:
First, math is not a spectator sport and is all about practice and getting feedback on your work. So make sure you are practicing everything you are studying or reviewing and having proofs looked at by others/professors (this goes for econ courses as well). </br>
Second, the graduate program at Duke is likely much more theoretical in nature than you what experiences as an undergraduate. For this reason we cannot stress enough that you should work on your proof writing and understanding of set theory (please see the book of proof). </br> 
Third, for general review I always recommend looking at MIT’s OpenCourseware (OCW). They have a ton of lectures, assignments, and exams open sourced especially when it comes to math. And lastly, make sure to do reviews a few days after you learn something, spaced repetition and other learning hacks are real. 

# Resources
## Proof Writing 
- As stated above, any economics or computer science course you will take at Duke requires at least a basic understanding of sets and proofs. 
- Please refer to [this](/economics/proofs_and_sets.md) doc

## Calculus
- Khan Academy – For a speed run review of calculus Khan Academy is a great resource in both its explanations and forced practice. Biggest weakness is that the questions are not always super rigorous. 
- [Paul’s Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) – This is a collection of notes, practice problems, assignments for the standard calculus sequence. This is more rigorous than Khan Academy
- Mathematics for Economists by Simon and Blume – This is an econ specific resource directed towards older undergrads. Most of this is very applied so it isn’t all applicable to the work you would do during your master’s but can be a good review. Additionally, there is a good amount of optimization and concavity later on which will be helpful for microeconomics (601)

## Linear Algebra
- [Gilbert Strangs Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) – When it comes to linear algebra this is the gold standard. Knowledge of Linear Algebra up to Lecture 16 will be helpful for Econ 608 while those take machine learning courses should be familiar with the whole course. 

## Prob & Stats
- [Harvard Stats 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube) – This is a good video resource to help one rebuild their base in probability. If you are relearning please do the exercises as you will struggle without a lot of practice
- A First Course in Probabiliity by Sheldon Ross - This textbook is generally in undergraduate probability courses and includes many exercises to help with learning 
- [MIT Intro to Stats for Economics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-30-introduction-to-statistical-methods-in-economics-spring-2009/) – This is a much more rigorous intro to stats via MIT. There are no lecture videos but they have some very concise, albeit tough, lecture notes
